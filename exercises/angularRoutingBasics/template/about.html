                <p id="para">Addis Ababa or Addis Abeba (the spelling used by the official Ethiopian Mapping Authority),(Amharic: አዲስ አበባ? Addis Abäba IPA: [adˈdis ˈabəba] ( listen), "new flower"; Oromo: Finfinne,[3][4] [fɪnˈfɪ́n.nɛ́] "Natural Spring(s)"), is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. It has a population of 3,384,569 according to the 2007 population census, with annual growth rate of 3.8%. This number has been increased from the originally published 2,738,248 figure and appears to be still largely underestimated.
                As a chartered city (ras gez astedader), Addis Ababa has the status of both a city and a state. It is where the African Union is and its predecessor the OAU was based. It also hosts the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and numerous other continental and international organizations. Addis Ababa is therefore often referred to as "the political capital of Africa" due to its historical, diplomatic and political significance for the continent.[6]

The city is populated by people from different regions of Ethiopia. It is home to Addis Ababa University. The Federation of African Societies of Chemistry (FASC) and Horn of Africa Press Institute (HAPI) are also headquartered in Addis Ababa.</p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" href="#">More &raquo;</a>
